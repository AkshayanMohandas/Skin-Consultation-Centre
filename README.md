# Skin Consultation Management System

The **Skin Consultation Management System** is a Java-based application designed to manage doctors, patient consultations, and related data for a Skin Consultation Centre. This project was developed as part of my coursework at the **Informatics Institute of Technology (IIT), Sri Lanka**, following object-oriented programming principles.
